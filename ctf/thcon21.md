This page contains my writeups for the CTF of the 2021 edition of the [Toulouse Hacking Convention](https://21.thcon.party/) (refered to as THCon21).

The CTF was hosted on a different [site](https://ctf.thcon.party/).

This edition had 38 challenges split between the following categories: `intro`, `cryptography`, `pwn`, `reverse`, `Windows`, `steganography`, `web`, `app script` and `programmation`
